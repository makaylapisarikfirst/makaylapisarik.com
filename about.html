   <p class="about_discription" >I, Makayla Pisarik, am currently studying at F.I.R.S.T Institution to become a Graphic Designer. My goal is to find myself working at a Design Firm. I love all graphic design; however, I find particularly branding and advertising for business interesting and strive to further my skills in marketing and graphic design.  Because of my hands-on help with State Street Beard Co., I have found a passion for helping them design advertisements and photographing her products. I am eager to take this experience and knowledge from school and further my exposure. I am currently looking for an internship to further my experience in the design field. I want to learn from other professional designers how to better satisfy customers with my designs.</p>
