 <h4 class="title">First School Photoshoot</h4>
 <p class="discription" >In this project I took pictures of any radnom object and made an advertisment for it. It was in the summer time and I had bought my favorite classic snack the Bomb Pop. I never saw advertisments of the Bombs Pops that I could remember. I searched it up on google to be disappointed in Bomb Pops lacking of advertisments. Taking to this inspiration I created the perfect 4th of July advertisment that the Bomb Pop company could appriciate.  </p>
