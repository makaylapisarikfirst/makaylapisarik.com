 <h4 class="title">First School Photoshoot</h4>
 <p class="discription" >In this project, I took pictures of any random object and made an advertisment for it. It was in the summer time and I had bought my favorite classic snack, the Bomb Pop. I never saw advertisments for Bomb Pops that I could remember. I searched it up on google only to be disappointed in Bomb Pops lacking of advertisments. Taking to this inspiration, I designed the perfect 4th of July advertisment that Bomb Pop company could appreciate.</p>

 <p class="discription"> I used many collective parts within this project. I took multiple photos to get different angles and ensure the lighting was spot on. I combined the best photos to recreate the sharpest model. I went on Illustrator to design the text that would best-fit Bomb Pop's colorful design and applied them to photoshop. Here is a collection of the parts I used to create the final product. </p>
