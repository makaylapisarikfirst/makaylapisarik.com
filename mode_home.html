    <h4 class="title">Mode Home Project</h4>
    <p class="discription">For this project, I created 4 pages for Mode Home Magazine. Mode Home was a magazine that sold home goods and furniture. I had to design the main cover for Mode Home going with the Modern Home feature. I was assigned to design the furniture catalog that displays the 7 couches they were selling. I designed a full image page with a header and description. I also created 2 article pages one for Crafty Creek Furniture and Mode Home Modern Style article.  </p>
