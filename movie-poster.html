      <h3 class="title">Illustrator Movie Poster</h3>
        <p class="discription">For this school project, I had to create a movie poster. The objective was to design an 11 x 17 " poster in Illustrator about my favorite movie. The poster needed to express the knowledge and skills I acquired in my Illustrator class. The movie I choose was "As Above So Below". This movie genre is thriller, horror, and mystery. It is about a team of explorers who venture into the Paris Catacombs. There the explorers uncover a dark secret that lies beneath the city of the dead. </p>

        <h4 class="title">Revisions</h4>
        <p class="discription">As a designer, it's important to listen to critiques about your work. At the end of the course, we had to bring back our old designs and readvise them. For my Illustrator course, I decided to improve my movie poster. Below are the revisions that I made.</p>
