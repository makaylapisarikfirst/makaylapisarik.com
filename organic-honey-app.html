        <p class="discription">For this school project I had to create an application for a fake business of my choosing. I decided to continue on with the brand Oraganic Honey from the Organic Honey Wireframe. I designed a hi-def prototype of the application within Adobe XD. I used the same styleguide as the website to keep the brand sincranized. </p>
